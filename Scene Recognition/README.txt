utils.py
	load_data - This function loads the test images and train images
	
	KNN_classifier - This takes the train images, train labels, test images, and number of negibors to perform KNN classifier using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier[1] and return how the test images correspond to the classifier
	
	SVM_classifier - This takes train images, train labels, test images, boolean, and svm lambda to perform SVM classifier using sklearn.svm.SVC[2] to make the classifier with the train images and train lables and return how the test images correspond to the classifier

	imresize - This resizes the input image to be target_size x target_size and return the normalized[3] image

	reportAccuracy - This returns how the predicted labels are performing with respect to the true label

	buildDict - This creates descriptors corresponding to the feature type and put the descriptors of all images into a clustring type (Kmeans[4], Agglomerative[5]) and return the vocabulary with specified size (dict_size). Since the sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering does not have cluster_centers_, we needed to manually set the centiod for this clustering type

	computeBow - This returns the computed BOW (Bag of Words) for a given image. We first used feature to make descriptor of the given image and use that to create histogram and return the normalized histogram

	tinyImages - This resizes the train images to 8x8 16x16 and 32x32 and return the accuracy and runtime when the train images are fed to the KNN classifier

homework1.py
	This files runs the functions in utils.py file to create the .npy files. Since the runtime of making vocabulary and Bow is long, we decided to use the .npy file instead of keep making new vocabularies and Bows. Once the .npy files for vocabulary and bow are created, we load the files to use as our vocabulary and bow to check the accuracy and runtime.
